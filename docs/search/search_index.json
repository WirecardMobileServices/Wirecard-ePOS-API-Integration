Note Sale is central ePOS object. It must contain amount to pay and at least one payment transaction . Additionally, Sale may include sale items (also called shopping basket), reference to merchant shop , reference to cash register and other optional sale information. Wirecard ePOS allows merchants to divide total amount to multiple payment transactions. Example Jeans in value of 100 \u20ac are paid by two payment transactions: 60 \u20ac is paid by card and 40 \u20ac is paid in cash .

Authentication and Security First of all, you need to have Wirecard ePOS API credentials (username & password) in order to successfully authenticate with Wirecard ePOS API. At the moment, only basic access authentication is supported. Tip Please contact your Wirecard representative to obtain your personal credentials. If you don't know your Wirecard representative, please contact us at retail.mpos@wirecard.com Note In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a username and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field of the form Authorization: Basic , where credentials is the base64 encoding of id and password joined by a colon. HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. The BA mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way. Therefore, Basic Authentication is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality. When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the Authorization field. The Authorization field is constructed as follows: The username and password are combined with a single colon (:). This means that the username itself cannot contain a colon. The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence. The character set to use for this encoding is by default unspecified, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII, but the server may suggest use of UTF-8 by sending the charset parameter. The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64. The authorization method and a space (e.g. \"Basic \") is then prepended to the encoded string. For example, if the browser uses Aladdin as the username and OpenSesame as the password, then the field's value is the base64-encoding of Aladdin:OpenSesame, or QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l. Then the Authorization header will appear as: \u201cAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l\u201d See Wikipedia for more details.

Note Payment acceptance functionality is usually a subset of a larger solution. Throughout this guide we therefore refer to the functionality you create via Wirecard ePOS API as the payment acceptance functionality, even though it may not be a standalone system. Who is this for? For organizations (we call them partners) who want to utilize Wirecard ePOS API in order to enhance their solution with payment acceptance functionality. Merchants are the actual end-users of the payment acceptance functionality. Tip If you are new to the payment industry there are a lot of terms to learn. So, the terms partner, merchant, user, payment acceptance application and many others are all defined in Glossary to help you with this task. Glossary has also definitions for the most common acronyms you find in this integration guide, such as Purchase, Return, Payment transaction and others. How much is covered? Our goal is to provide as much information as needed to successfully create a payment acceptance solution in the shortest possible time. Core Integration covers core functionality which has to be integrated. Advanced Integration covers value added functionality which is not mandatory. How technical is it? Partner team typically consists of a non-technical or semi-technical project manager and one or more developers who are technical. This guide is for the whole team so the information here ranges from non-technical to technical. What do I need to know?

Since its start as a chat app, WeChat has grown to become a market-leading platform by connecting people, services, and businesses in China and around the world. Tip Visit Wirecard website to find out all benefits of WeChat barcode payment. From retailer perspective, WeChat can be either one-step or two-step payment. In case end-consumer (buyer) is not prompted to authorize payment on his device then all is needed is one PURCHASE request. In case end-consumer has to authorize the payment with password or other equivalent (pin code, fingerprint, etc.) then initial PURCHASE request has to be confirmed by follow-up CONFIRM request. Note Sale requests are serviced at https://switch.wirecard.com/mswitch-server/v1/sales URL. Purchase Operation In context of Wirecard ePOS, every payment transaction is part of a Sale . In order to process WeChat payment, call Wirecard ePOS API with Sale-PURCHASE request defined below: Request { \"multitender\": \"true\", \"operation\" : \"PURCHASE\", \"totalAmount\" : 10, \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\", \"payments\" : [ { \"paymentMethod\" : \"WECHAT\", \"transactionType\" : \"PURCHASE\", \"amount\" : 10, \"consumerId\" : \"15050011719660761\" } ] } \"multitender\" - boolean flag \"TRUE\" - required; compliant with newest Sale Model, which is described in this integration guide \"FALSE\" - deprecated; old Sale Model is not addressed in this integration guide \"operation\" - defines type of Sale request; \"PURCHASE\" operation creates new Sale-Purchase record \"externalId\" - optional - meant to be used for integrator tracking purpose; it is forwarded to payment gateway \"totalAmount\" - defines amount of Sale-Purchase \"currencyCode\" - defines currency, based on ISO 4217 standard \"payments\" - payment-specific information; one payment transaction per one request is supported \"paymentMethod\" - defines payment method \"transactionType\" - defines type of this transaction; \"PURCHASE\" transaction type moves funds from end-consumer to merchant \"amount\" - defines transaction amount \"consumerId\" - value of scanned barcode (QR code) Note In context of Wirecard ePOS, term Purchase is used for both: type of Sale - defined more specifically as Sale-Purchase transaction type - e.g. alipay purchase transaction, cash purchase transaction, etc. Response indicating 1-step WeChat payment In order to identify whether the follow-up CONFIRM request is required, status code has to be parsed.
