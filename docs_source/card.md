## Transaction Types

Wirecard ePOS supports following transaction types:

- **[Purchase](card-purchase-flow.md)** - takes funds from the cardholder's account. It is one-step process to conduct two transaction types: Authorization and Capture.
- **[Authorization & Capture](card-auth-flow.md)** - Authorization reserves funds from the cardholder's account. Merchant has 7 days left to conduct Capture on the Authorization transaction.
- **[Reversal](card-reversal-flow.md)** - releases reserved funds from the cardholder's account. It is used to solve specific situations, e.g. in case when a Purchase, Authorization or Capture transaction was triggered accidentally.
- **[Reference Refund](card-reference-refund-flow.md)** - gives funds to the cardholder's account. It has to refer to an eligible Purchase or Capture transaction.
