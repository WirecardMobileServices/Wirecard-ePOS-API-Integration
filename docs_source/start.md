## Welcome to the Wirecard ePOS API Partner Documentation

The Wirecard ePOS API is part of Wirecard's range of mobile Point of Sale
 (mPOS) products and solutions. For complete information about all of 
 Wirecard's mPOS solutions, contact your Wirecard representative.

The Wirecard ePOS API enables the integration point to enrich your system with
functionality that expands the number of payment methods that merchants 
can accept from their consumers, including Visa, Mastercard, 
Alipay and WeChatPay. Cash can also be accepted and processed 
so that merchants can process all transactions through a 
single solution created with the help of the Wirecard ePOS API.

### Who is this for?
Wirecard works with partners who use the Wirecard ePOS API to include in their
existing systems payment acceptance functionality for merchants. 
This documentation is for these partners. Partners are typically companies 
that specialize in software application development. Merchants are the actual 
end-users of the payment acceptance app functionality. Partners 
typically create app functionality to support payment acceptance 
by merchants, and this functionality is usually a subset of a larger 
solution, so throughout this documentation we refer to the functionality that 
you create with the API as the payment acceptance, even though it may 
not be a standalone system.

!!! Tip 
    If you are new to the payment industry there are a lot of terms
    to learn. So, the terms partner, merchant, user, payment acceptance app
    and many others are all defined in the Glossary to help you with this
    task. The Glossary also has definitions for the most common acronyms you
    find on this documentation site, such as SEPA, mPOS and others.

### How much is covered?
Everything! Our goal is to provide all the information that our partners 
need to successfully create a payment acceptance system in the shortest 
possible time. So, we have introductory and overview information, architectural
 explanations, software setup information and detailed developer documentation,
 ranging from integration guides to comprehensive object class references.
 The Using This Documentation chapter shows you how to use each section of 
 this documentation site.
 
### How technical is it?
 A partner team typically consists of a non-technical or semi-technical 
 project manager and one or more developers who are technical. 
 This documentation is for the whole team so the information here 
 ranges from non-technical to very technical.
 
### What do I need to know?
Project managers on the technical team do not require any specific skills. 
Developers should have these skills:

- understanding of REST API calls
- understanding of JSON objects
