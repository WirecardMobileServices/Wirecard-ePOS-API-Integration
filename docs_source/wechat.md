WeChat Pay is one of Chinaâ€˜s leading payment methods. Since its start as a chat app, WeChat has grown to become a market-leading platform by connecting people, services, and businesses in China and around the world.

!!! Tip
    
    Visit [Wirecard website](https://www.wirecard.com/payment-base/wechat-pay) to find out all benefits of WeChat payment.

From merchant perspective, WeChat can be either [one-step](#1-step-wechat-payment) or [two-step](#2-step-wechat-payment) payment:

- In case end-consumer (buyer) is not prompted to authorize payment on his device then all is needed is [one request](#purchase-operation).

- In case end-consumer (buyer) is prompted to authorize payment with password or other equivalent (pin code, fingerprint, etc.) then merchant has to query Wirecard ePOS system in order to get the final status of WeChat transaction. Technically-wise, it means that initial [request](#purchase-operation) (_PURCHASE_) has to be followed by [query request](#confirm-operation) (_CONFIRM_).

!!! Note
    
    Purchase requests are serviced at following URL:
    
        https://switch.wirecard.com/mswitch-server/v1/sales

    In context of Wirecard ePOS, term **Purchase** is used for both:
    
    - type of Sale - called _Sale-Purchase_ - created by request with PURCHASE operation
    - transaction type - _cash purchase_ transaction, _card purchase_ transaction, _alipay purchase_ transaction and _wechat purchase_ transaction
    
## Purchase Operation

In order to process WeChat payment, make a [`POST /v1/sales`](https://switch.wirecard.com/mswitch-server/v1/sales) call:

### Request

    {
        "multitender": "true",
        "operation" : "PURCHASE",
        "note" : "Example Note",
        "externalId": "123456789",
        "totalAmount" : 10,
        "currencyCode" : "EUR",
        "payments" : [
            {

                "amount" : 10,
                "consumerId" : "15050011719660761"
            }
        ]
    }

    - `"TRUE"` - required
    - `"FALSE"` - deprecated

## Reverse Operation

_REVERSE_ operation is typically used in case purchase transaction was created accidentally and hence needs to be reversed.

In order to reverse WeChat purchase transaction, make a [`POST /v1/sales`](https://switch.wirecard.com/mswitch-server/v1/sales) call:

### Reverse Request

    {
        "operation": "REVERSE",
        "originalSaleId": "a0a09836df08426b92d4805294bdae42",

                "originalTransactionId" : "809364e83e3043c7a15182140d55268e"
            }
        ]
    }

- `"operation"` - defines type of Sale request
- `"originalSaleId"` - identifier of original Sale-Purchase
- `"payments"` - includes payment-specific information
    - `"paymentMethod"` - defines payment method; it must be same as original payment transaction
    - `"transactionType"` - defines type of this transaction; `"REVERSE"` operation must include `"REVERSAL"` transaction type
    - `"originalTransactionId"` - identifier of original purchase transaction

            }
        ]
    }

In order to explicitly [change state of Sale-Purchase to CANCELED](multi-tender.md#what-is-sale-lifecycle-model), make a  `POST /v1/sales` call with [_CANCEL_ operation](multi-tender.md#what-is-cancel-operation).
    
## Return Operation

_RETURN_ operation is used in case end-consumer returns merchandise and asks for a refund. Wirecard ePOS support partial as well as full return.
